  <h3>Learning HTML with ALX</h3>

  <!-- Paragraphs -->
  <p>This is my very first webpage created with HTML. Iâ€™m excited to start my journey as a web developer.</p>
  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the foundation of every webpage you see online.</p>
  <p>In this project, I am learning how to use headings, paragraphs, and images to build structured content.</p>
  <p>By the end of this, I will be ready to style my page with CSS and make it interactive with JavaScript!</p>
